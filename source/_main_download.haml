          Beyond the starter pack, Cappuccino comes with a number of tools to make it easy to create new applications. With or without the starter pack, you can install all of Cappuccino and accompanying tools with the following command:
        %pre
          %code
            curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/v0.9.10/bootstrap.sh >/tmp/cb.sh &amp;&amp; bash /tmp/cb.sh
