Our very own Francisco Tolmasky is speaking at the upcoming [AJAX Experience](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/) conference on September 30th in Boston.

Francisco will be presenting a brief overview of Cappuccino during a&nbsp;[5 minute lightning talk](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/javascript.html#FTolmaskyObj) (11:05-11:10 am), as well as a full length presentation called "[The Road to Cappuccino"](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/javascript.html#FTolmaskyCapp)&nbsp;(1:05-2:05 pm), which will provide a more in depth overview of the technologies, as well as a history and rationale of the development of Cappuccino.

### The Road to Cappuccino

with&nbsp;[Francisco Tolmasky](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#FTolmasky), Co-Founder, 280 North; Creator, Objective-J programming language

This session explores the story behind the development of the Objective-J language and Cappuccino frameworks.&nbsp;This will not only serve as an introduction to building Cappuccino applications, but also shed some light on why this particular course was chosen when developing these technologies.&nbsp; Francisco discusses the future of the open source project and the next steps being taken with Objective-J and Cappuccino.

### Cappuccino/Objective-J

with&nbsp;[Francisco Tolmasky](http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#FTolmasky), Co-Founder, 280 North; Objective-J programming language

This lightening round introduces Cappuccino and Objective-J and the road to going open source. Cappuccino was implemented using a new programming language called Objective-J, which is modeled after Objective-C and built entirely on top of JavaScript. Programs written in Objective-J are interpreted in the client, so no compilation or plug-ins are required. Hear from Francisco Tolmasky, creator of the Objective-J language.

If you're at AJAX Experience, be sure to check out these talks, and introduce yourself to Francisco! (don't worry, he doesn't bite, usually)
