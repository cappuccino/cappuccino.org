Thomas Balthazar, who's been doing the recent "This Week in Edge Cappuccino" series (read [this week's post](http://suitmymind.com/2009/02/05/this-week-in-edge-cappuccino-3/)), also started a new site to host [screencasts of Cappuccino & Objective-J tutorials](http://cappuccinocasts.com). So far he's created a screencast for the [starter tutorial](http://suitmymind.com.s3.amazonaws.com/screencasts/cappuccinocasts.com/001/001_cappuccino_sample_application.mov).&nbsp;

We're all looking forward to seeing more screencasts on the site, and if you want to contribute your own screencast, get in touch with Thomas and he'll add it to the site. Thanks Thomas!
