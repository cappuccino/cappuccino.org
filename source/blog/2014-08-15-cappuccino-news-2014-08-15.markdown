Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

#### Changes/Fixes

##### Cappuccino

- The blurred `CPPopover` animation in Google Chrome has been fixed.

- The transient or semi-transient `CPPopover` now closes on a right click.

- The checking of the usability of a `CPTextField` in a `CPPlatformWindow` takes into account the content-inset value of the `CPTextField`.

- The method delegate `- (void)popoverDidShow:(CPPopover)aPopover` is called for a `CPPopover` even without animation.

- A memory leaks has been fixed in the `CPOutlineView`. When reloading a `CPOutlineView` with new data, the class previosuly kept a reference of old data.

- The following methods of the `CPOutlineView` now only work for displayed items:
    - `- (BOOL)isExpandable:(id)anItem`
    - `- (BOOL)isItemExpanded:(id)anItem`
    - `- (CPInteger)rowForItem:(id)anItem`
    - `- (CPInteger)levelForItem:(id)anItem`
    - `- (id)itemAtRow:(CPInteger)aRow`
    - `- (CPInteger)levelForItem:(id)anItem`
    - `- (CPInteger)levelForRow:(CPInteger)aRow`

##### Cucapp

- The method `def simulate_mouse_moved_on_point x, y, flags` has been added. You can now simulate the `CPMouseMoved` event in your tests.
