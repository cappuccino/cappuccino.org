### Major releases

Cappuccino 0.9.9 has been released! This release arrives almost exactly a year after the 0.9.8 version and in that year we have been busy. No matter what your Cappuccino app is about, there is something in this release for you. As always the full change log and release notes are available [here](/cappuccino-release-notes.html).

[NUKit](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit), [NUAristo](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nukit-theme), [Bambou](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/objj-bambou) and [Garuda](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/garuda) have been released by Antoine Mercadal and Christophe Serafin from [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net). This collection of frameworks allows you to easily create a new Cappuccino Application which will communicate with a ReST Python server generated by Garuda. And good news, it's lightweight due to the flat theme NUAristo!

[LightObject Framework](https://github.com/mrcarlberg/LightObject) has been released by Martin Carlberg from [Oops](http://www.oops.se). Now you can create your Cappuccino Application model through Xcode. Martin showed this framework communicating with an Objective-J server running on NodeJS during the Cappcon.

### The 31st March 2016

The CappCon 2016 was held at the University Of Liège in Belgium. Around 50 people came for this day and there were talks for everybody - technical talks as well as abstract talks about Cappuccino.

### The Talkers

### Every good thing has an end

After 8 hours of talking about Cappuccino, it was the time to celebrate this second CappCon! We guess we all agree that Belgium beers have a good reputation (which they deserve) and we hope that everybody had fun during this evening!

We hope that everybody enjoyed this CappCon and had a great time in Belgium!

It was very exciting for us and we hope to organize another CappCon soon again!

To finish , we would like to thanks our sponsors who made this possible! Thank you to [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net), [Oops](http://www.oops.se), [RWElephant](http://www.rwelephant.com) and the [University of Liège](https://www.ulg.ac.be).
