The Cappuccino community is buzzing with activity. Here's a recap of recent news.

Followers of the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/objectivej) will know that work on Objective-J 2.0 is in full swing. This improved compiler which will generate much faster execution performance for Cappuccino apps. Multiple people are working on various versions - [Christopher Bruno](https://bitbucket.org/cbruno/objective-j), [Martin Carlberg](http://github.com/mrcarlberg/language) and [Francisco Tolmasky](https://github.com/tolmasky/language/tree/master/languages/Objective-J). Presently Martin is trying out an [acorn based](https://github.com/mrcarlberg/acorn) parser with promising performance.

Continuous integration for Cappuccino has [been reintroduced](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/objectivej-dev/2sNWmeZi2Zw), this time on [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/cappuccino/cappuccino). This means all unit tests are run against every new pull request and commit, which should help avoid accidental unit test breakage.

It has been a while since the (perhaps not aptly named) Cappuccino 0.9.6 RC2 was released, which we [announced](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/objectivej/svifpqxvjfA/DZ7HXJjSr14J) in August on the mailing list. You can now read about some highlights from the RC2 release here: [New in Cappuccino 0.9.6 RC2](http://www.slevenbits.com/blog/2012/09/cappuccino-0.9.6-rc2.html).
