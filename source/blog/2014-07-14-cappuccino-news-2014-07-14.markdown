Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

#### Community

- Developers of `Cappuccino` are now on http://gitter.im/cappuccino/cappuccino. Don't hesitate to come and ask whatever you want!

#### New features

- `Cucapp` is now available in a sub-repository of `Cappuccino` (https://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp). Thanks Daniel Parnell!

- Some new major features have been added to `Cucapp`:
    * `Cucapp` provides several environment variables to configure your tests.
    * `Cucapp` supports file names such as `CPTextField+IP.j`.
    * Internal categories were added to add new features (in Cappuccino) needed for your tests.
    * `cucappIdentifier`, added by one of the above categories, allows you to easily access a `CPResponder` in your tests.
    * A set of new APIs were added. You can now simulate mouse/keyboard events in your tests.

- The `CPPopover` works with the behavior `CPPopoverBehaviorSemitransient`.

- `CPURLConnection` now has the methods `- (BOOL)withCredentials` and `- (void)setWithCredentials:`. The new functionality supported is like that of `withCredentials` for an `XMLHttpRequest`.

- The methods `+(void)setUp` and `+(void)tearDown` are now called when launching a test with `OJUnit`.

- `OJUnit` provides an option to run only one test now.

#### Changes/Fixes

- The escape key works as in Cocoa when a `CPPopover` or `CPPanel` is open.

- Animation of a `CPopover` works as in Cocoa when disappearing.

- `CPAttributedString` coalesces attributes correctly.
