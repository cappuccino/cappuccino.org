Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino in the last month.

### Community

Cappuccino 0.9.9 has now been released! This release follows almost exactly a year from 0.9.8 and in that year we have been busy. No matter what your Cappuccino app is about, there is something in this release for you. You should check it out here : http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2016/03/cappuccino-0-9-9.html

If you missed the CappCon2016, we will provide the story, videos, powerpoint and pictures about this amazing day at the Univeristy of Liège soon!
