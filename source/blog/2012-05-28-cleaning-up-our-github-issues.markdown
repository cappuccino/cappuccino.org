We're very pleased to today announce our new Cappuccino Issue Reviewers. You might already have seen them cleaning up the [issue backlog](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/issues) over at GitHub, sometimes closing already fixed bugs, sometimes tagging and structuring up languishing issues.

Our new reviewers are (in alphabetical order):

* [Adam Radabaugh](http://github.com/aradabaugh)
* [Arjen Schipmolder](http://github.com/schipmolder)
* [Bruce Doan](http://github.com/rgv151)
* [Joe Wollard](http://github.com/buffalo)
* [Mandaris Moore](http://github.com/mandaris)
* [Sato Takenori](http://github.com/ggsato)

The issue reviewers will be helping the project tremendously with their diligence and volunteering of time, so we hope we speak for everyone in the Cappuccino project in saying: welcome!

_- The Cappuccino Core Developer Team_
