Today we are very happy announce that Cappuccino 0.9.8 has just been released and it's ready for you to use. This release if focused on stability and bug fixes (~200 bugs squashed) but also delivers some very cool new features.

#### Notable Improvements

- Added the keyword `@typdef`.

Example:

    :::objj
    @import <Foundation/Foundation.j>

    @typedef NUSuppaType

    @implementation NUMyClass: CPObject
    {
         NUSuppaType mode;
    }
    @end

- New: `CFError`, `CPURLErrors` and `CFError`.
- Added support for **multiline CPTextFields**.
