Today [Michael Villar](http://twitter.com/michaelvillar) has released Version 4.0 of [PicsEngine](http://picsengine.com), a photo management utility. Version 4.0 has been completely rewritten making use of Cappuccino for the photo administration. This beautiful new application features an entirely custom UI designed by Michael himself.
