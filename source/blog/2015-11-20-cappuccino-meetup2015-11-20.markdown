Hi guys,

We are excited to announce that we have launched our Worldwide Cappuccino Meetup [page](http://www.meetup.com/World-Cappuccino-Meetup/).

Meetups are going to be organized regularly throughout the year. We advise you to join this group to stay up to date about future events we will organize!

The first Meetup will be the CappCon2016 in Li√®ge (Belgium). You can register for free  [here](http://www.meetup.com/World-Cappuccino-Meetup/events/226898401/).

[Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net) will organize meetups every 3-4 months in Mountain View, Califorina. These meetups will cover different themes such as testing, demos, libraries, good practices and more. The first meetup will be held in mid-April (date to be decided). The theme of this meetup, presented by Antoine Mercadal, will be 'Nuage Networks and Cappuccino'.

If you would like to organize a meetup on your own somewhere else, let us know on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cappuccino/cappuccino).

Thanks and see you soon!
