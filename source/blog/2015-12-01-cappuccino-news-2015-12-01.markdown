### Cappuccino

##### News

- New: runtime methods `objj_msgSend`, `objj_msgSendSuper` and `objj_method` are now faster. Possibility to inline functions when compiling with the option `-O2` or the compiler flag `InlineMsgSend`. Arrays and dictionaries use more efficient code. This improves app speed by up to 20%.
