[Elias Klughammer](http://github.com/eliasklughammer) has taken the time to put together a demo of using the new [Tornado web server](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) to bring push to Cappuccino applications. Tornado is a brand new non-blocking server recently open sourced by Facebook which was built to deal with the high intensity demands of [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com). When combined with Cappuccino, the results are pretty impressive:
