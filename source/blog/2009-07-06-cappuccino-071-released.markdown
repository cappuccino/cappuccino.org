This is maintenance release for 0.7 and includes mainly bug fixes. You can see a complete list of changes in our [release notes](http://groups.google.com/group/objectivej/browse_thread/thread/bd0a946dc6b0c790), or look at a quick summary here:

**Summary**

* Improvements to the way nib2cib handles custom classes in nibs.
* Improvements to menus and menu items in nib2cib
* Added automatic drag and drop support to CPImageView
* Better JSON support
* Better UTF8 Support
* Updated included version of Narwhal (http://narwhaljs.org/)

One completely new feature we added is an auto generated showcase app for the theming API we introduced in 0.7. This showcase allows you to better test your themes under a number of different conditions. You can check out the one for Aristo [here](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/aristo/showcase).
