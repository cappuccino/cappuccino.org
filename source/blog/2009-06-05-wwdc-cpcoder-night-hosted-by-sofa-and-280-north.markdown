If you're in town for [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/), or happen to be in San Francisco already, stop by [CPCoder Night on Monday](http://cpcoder.eventbrite.com/) for a chance to meet [280 North](http://280north.com/), [Sofa](http://madebysofa.com), and dozens of other [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/) developers. It's taking place from 7-9PM in the Martini Lounge at [Jillian's](http://sanfrancisco.jilliansbilliards.com/), in the Metreon across the street from Moscone West.

Thanks to sponsorship by Sofa there will be food!

If you can't make it before 9:00 we'll likely be hanging around the bar at Jillian's after, but check [@280north](http://twitter.com/280north) on Twitter for updates.
