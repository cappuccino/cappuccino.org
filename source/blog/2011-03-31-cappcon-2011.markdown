Hey everybody,

We're excited to announce the first ever full-blown conference dedicated to Cappuccino: CappCon 2011.

It'll be in San Francisco, June 11-12. That's the weekend after WWDC,
so for those of you coming for that, be sure to extend your stay by a
few nights.

We will post more details soon, but we want to get that date out there so you don't miss it!

It's going to be a lot of fun.

Be sure to sign up for ticket information when it's posted on the official website here:[http://cappcon.org](http://cappcon.org).

If you have any quick questions you can ping [@cappuccino](http://twitter.com/cappuccino) on Twitter, or email Paul at paul@baumgart.us. And definitely get in touch if you think your company might be interested in sponsoring the conference.
