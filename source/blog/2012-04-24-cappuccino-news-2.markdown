#### New features

- Basic support has been added for `NSDateFormatter` in `nib2cib`. (Alexander Ljungberg)

- Lazy support for `bytes()` and `base64()` added to `CFData`, `+dataWithBytes` and `+dataWithBase64` methods added to `CPData`. (cacaodev)

- `capp_lint` has been added to the Tools directory. `capp_lint` is a command-line tool to check code conformance with the Cappuccino style conventions. Anyone submitting pull requests should use `capp_lint`. Note that if you use the SublimeLinter plugin with Sublime Text 2, `capp_lint` is built in. (Aparajita Fishman)

- Fixed a crash when removing objects from an array controller which has its `arrangedObjects.@count` observed. (Alexander Ljungberg)

- Fixed: a collection view wouldn't become the first responder when its items were clicked. (Alexander Ljungberg)

- Fixed `CPScrollView` trying to access subviews in `-initWithCoder`. (Aparajita Fishman)

- Added an `xcode-select` warning to `bootstrap.sh`. (Alexander Ljungberg)
