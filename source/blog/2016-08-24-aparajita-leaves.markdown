As of last month, Aparajita Fishman has left the Cappuccino project to take on a role at Apple.

Aparajta was one of our longest serving core developers. He joined the team in 2011 and has contributions going back to mid 2010 before that. He contributed countless hours to the benefit of all who enjoy Cappuccino. Some highlights include the Cup upload framework, extensive work on font metrics, XcodeCapp, `CPSearchField`, how themes are defined, our documentation, `CPLog`, `CPGraphics` drawing, `CPFormatter`, `capp_lint`, `nib2cib`, key view loop, child windows, and the list goes on. Along the way he fixed countless bugs: so many it would be silly to try to list them all. Seriously, [see for yourself](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commits?author=aparajita).

Aparajita, thank you for all your great work on Cappuccino and we hope you'll show them how it's done over at Apple!
