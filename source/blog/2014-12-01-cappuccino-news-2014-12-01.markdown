Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

### Cappuccino

##### New features

- The keyword `@typedef` has been added to Objective-J. This keyword allows you to define new types for your application. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2254))

Example:

    :::objj
    @import <Foundation/Foundation.j>

    @typedef NUSuppaType

    @implementation NUMyClass: CPObject
    {
         NUSuppaType mode;
    }
    @end

The Objective-J compiler will not raise a warning for the type `NUSuppaType` anymore.

- New multi-line support for `CPTextField`. ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2257))

- The method `addObserverName:object:queue:usingBlock:` has been added to `CPNotificationCenter`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2261))

Example:

    :::objj
    var center = [CPNotificationCenter defaultCenter],
        observer = [center addObserverForName:TestNotification
                                       object:anObject
                                        queue:nil
                                   usingBlock:function(notification)
                                   {
                                       notificationCount += 1;
                                   }];

##### Changes/Fixes

- Fixed: the URL of the current release version of Cappuccino was wrong in the documentation. ([zittix](https://github.com/zittix) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2266))

- You can now set a specific height for a `CPTextField` even if a control size is set. ([t00f](https://github.com/t00f) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2258))

- Fixed: when a `CPTextField` was used to edit multiple rows through an `CPArrayController` (and the multiple selection placeholder would show), tabbing through the field would clear the bound value in the rows even though no edit was made. ([daboe01](https://github.com/daboe01) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2164))

- Fixed: in the `Jakefile` template, the configuration build environment parameter could have multiple values. Now this variable is correctly set by detecting the build environment. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2255))

- It's now possible to chain sheet dialogs in a `CPWindow`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2238))

- Fixed: opening a `CPMenu` with items and then opening a `CPMenu` without any items would cause a crash. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2260))
