Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino recently.

### Community

If you missed the CappCon2016, you can find the story of this amazing day [here](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2016/04/cappcon-2016.html)! Videos and slides have been released.

In a bit of sad news for the Cappuccino Community, Aparajita Fishman has left the Cappuccino project to take on a role at Apple. Thanks you for all your great work on Cappuccino and we hope you’ll show them how it’s done over at Apple! More information [here](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2016/08/aparajita-leaves.html).

Taking a step back to look at the last 6 months, we can see lots of improvements and news. To pick just a few, `CPView` has been optimized, while `CPAnimationContext` and `CPViewAnimator` have been added to the framework. As always, minor bugs have been fixed. The full list is below.

We are getting close to a new release Cappuccino 0.9.10, which will probably be released in October 2016!
