As you may know, Cappuccino's source code is managed using the [Git](http://git.or.cz/) version control system and is [hosted](http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/) on [GitHub](http://github.com/). Git is a great system for open-source projects, and GitHub makes it even more powerful and easy to use.

This week Cappuccino is the featured project on GitHub:
