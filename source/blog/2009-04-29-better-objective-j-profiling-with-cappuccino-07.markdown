I've written pretty extensively on the changes we've been working on in the WebKit profiler to make for a much better experience when using Objective-J [here](http://www.alertdebugging.com/2009/04/29/building-a-better-javascript-profiler-with-webkit/), but long story short if you download the latest WebKit nightlies with Cappuccino 0.7 your profile should look like this:

One of our main goals with Cappuccino 0.7 is to really make the entire development cycle shine. Part of this was focusing heavily on nib2cib so that developers can make their apps in a more visual way, but we also want to make it much easier to debug as well. Let us know if you have any particular suggestions for making debugging even better over at our new bug tracker hosted on github: http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/issues
