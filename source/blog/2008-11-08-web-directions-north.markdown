In February, we'll be running a workshop at the [Web Directions North](http://north.webdirections.org/) conference in Denver. It will be a [four hour workshop](http://north.webdirections.org/workshops#cappuccino-bootcamp) on getting started with Cappuccino and Objective-J.

Here's a blurb about the workshop:

> This workshop will get you started on building applications in Cappuccino and Objective-J. Attendees will not be expected to have any prior experience with these technologies, but some familiarity with JavaScript and Object Oriented concepts are recommended. By the end of the workshop you will be comfortable with Objective-J and have worked through the process of building a simple application in Cappuccino. You&rsquo;ll be introduced to common patterns, the most used classes, and you&rsquo;ll learn how to find new information as you need it.

If you're interested in attending the conference, or even just the workshop, you can use this discount code: **WDN09RB**. This will get you $50 off, making the conference $745 before December 14th, or the standalone workshop $195.

Here's some marketing content directly from Web Directions:
