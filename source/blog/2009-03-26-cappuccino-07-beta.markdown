A few days ago we posted a beta of the upcoming [0.7 release](http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/tree/0.7b) to github. We sent out some information to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/objectivej/browse_thread/thread/b513e1dc52ad1f89/e5aa3222bc52494a#e5aa3222bc52494a) and posted some info [on the wiki](http://wiki.github.com/280north/cappuccino/07-beta) as well.

Thomas Balthazar has also recapped a lot of the information in his latest installment of [This Week in Cappuccino Edge](http://suitmymind.com/2009/03/26/this-week-in-edge-cappuccino-10/). I encourage you to check it out and let us know how 0.7 beta is shaping up!
