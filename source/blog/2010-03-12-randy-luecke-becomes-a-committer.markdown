A little late to post this, but everyone in the Cappuccino has loved the work Randy ([Me1000](http://github.com/me1000)) has been doing on CPTableView. Thanks to his hard work and significant contributions, the table view component in Cappuccino is now a force to be reckoned with. So we're proud to have Randy as our latest Cappuccino committer, and we're looking forward to the table view features still to come.

Randy also has his own Cappuccino app he's been developing called [TimeTable](http://timetableapp.com/). It's a time tracking app thats set to launch soon, so keep an eye out!
