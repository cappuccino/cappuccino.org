Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino in the last month.

### Community

- [Capuccino 0.9.8](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2015/03/cappuccino-0-9-8.html) has been released this month. There are 745 changes between 0.9.7 and 0.9.8 so there’s something new for everyone here, not the least being an overall speed improvement.

### Cappuccino
