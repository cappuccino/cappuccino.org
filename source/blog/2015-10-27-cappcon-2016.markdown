Hey everybody,

The Cappuccino Core Team are planning to organize a conferance about Cappuccino and how people are using it.

It will be the perfect time to discuss Cappuccino itself, its future 0.9.9 release, see some new features, demos, concrete examples and a few surprises.

Please let us know if you would like to join this event by taking this [survey](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surveymonkey.com%2Fr%2FZ9P7L55&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEu1mNy0xq0iIBdsSpeftYkWTKEqw).

Location and time to be decided!
