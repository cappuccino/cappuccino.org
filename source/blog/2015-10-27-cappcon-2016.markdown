Hey everybody,

The Cappuccino Core Team are planning to organize a conference about Cappuccino and how people are using it.

It will be a perfect time to talk about Cappuccino, the future 0.9.9 release, see some new features, demos, concrete examples and a few surprises.

Please let us know if you would like to join us for this event by taking this [survey](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surveymonkey.com%2Fr%2FZ9P7L55&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEu1mNy0xq0iIBdsSpeftYkWTKEqw).

Location and time to be decided!

If you have any quick questions you can ping [@cappuccino](http://twitter.com/cappuccino) on Twitter, ask questions on [gitter](https://gitter.im/cappuccino/cappuccino) or on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/objectivej).
