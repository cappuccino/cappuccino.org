Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino in the last month.

### Cappuccino

##### News

- The graphical `CPDatePicker` now disallows dates outside of the specified `minDate` and `maxDate`. ([daboe01](https://github.com/daboe01) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2297))

- By default, Cappuccino now draws in high DPI when using `canvas2D`. You can disable this feature globally using the method `CPView +setAllowsHighDPIDrawing:`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2215))

- `CPView -setNeedsLayout:` and `CPView -needsLayout` have been added. This makes it possible to choose not to lay out a view when needed, whereas previously once a layout had been scheduled it would always occur. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2316))

- Removed unreachable code in `CPDOMDisplayServer.h`. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2300))

- The `CPStepper` class initializer methods returns an object of type `id` instead of `CPStepper`. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2294))

- The `CPTableView` class has been refactored and optimized. The methods `CPTableView -preparedViewAtColumn:row:` and `CPTableView -enumerateAvailableViewsUsingblock:` have been added.

- When the auto-complete menu for a `CPTokenField` is open, the Enter key is no longer forwarded to the application. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2319))


### Cucapp

##### News
