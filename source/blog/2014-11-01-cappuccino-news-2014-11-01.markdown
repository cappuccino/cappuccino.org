### Cappuccino

##### New

- The `CPSegmentedControl` supports the mini and small control size. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2226))

- Possibility to select part of a textual `CPDatePicker` when dragging. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2236))

##### Changes/Fixes

- `Key Value Observing` generated new and old values in the change dictionary regardless of the options provided when adding the observer. Now it respects the options passed in the method `addObserver:forKeyPath:options:context:`. Optimization has been added, the speed improvement is 10% to 200%. ([mrcarlberg](https://github.com/mrcarlberg) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2224)) and ([primalmotion](https://github.com/primalmotion) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/8eb52f9a888c2183b7ee022eb52cea24ce8bb8c8))

- The size of `CPSecuredtextField` is now calculated correctly by `nib2cib`. ([ahankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2234))

- Fixed: the total height of a `CPCollectionView` was too short and the `CPCollectionView` truncated the last view(s). ([daboe01](https://github.com/daboe01) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2150))

- When a `CPTableView` has its selection style set to `CPTableViewSelectionHighlightStyleNone`, don't require two clicks to select a control in a row anymore. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2231))

- The `CPTableView` won't enable the bezeled state of a non-selectable `CPTextField` when clicking on it. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2230))

- A selectable text mouse cursor style is shown when the mouse hovers above an enabled and editable or selectable `CPTextField`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2233))

- The size of `CPSegmentedControl` is now calculated correctly by `nib2cib`. ([Dogild](https://github.com/Dogild) - [PR](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/pull/2226))
