We've just finished the latest installment in the Scrapbook Tutorial Series. &nbsp;In Part II, we cover adding drag and drop to the application so that can begin allowing the user to start generating content. &nbsp;In the process we cover a number of other Cappuccino topics, including creating and setting up collection views, panels, and scroll views. &nbsp;We also briefly touch on the topic of serialization through Cappuccino's keyed archiving API. &nbsp;Make sure to [check it out](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/learn/tutorials/scrapbook-tutorial-2) and give us your feedback!
