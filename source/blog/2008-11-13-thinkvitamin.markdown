ThinkVitamin.com is featuring [an article](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/ajax/add-undo-and-redo-to-your-web-application-with-cappuccino) by Francisco that goes through the process of adding undo/redo support to an existing application. It uses a "furniture layout" application as the model, and goes through all the steps necessary to make user actions undoable.

This is a great demonstration of one of the powerful built-in features in Cappuccino, and a good read for anyone building an application in Cappuccino. Undo support is one of those features that goes a long way in making your application more enjoyable to use, and customers will love you for it.

So go [checkout the tutorial](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/ajax/add-undo-and-redo-to-your-web-application-with-cappuccino), then get started adding undo support to your own applications!
