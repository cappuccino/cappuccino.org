Here's a quick update on what's new with Cappuccino for the last two weeks.

#### Community

- [Cappuccino in action](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2014/07/cappuccino-in-action-nuage-networks.html) by Antoine Mercadal has been added to the blog.

- [Cucumber + Cappuccino = Cucapp](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2014/07/cappuccino-cucumber-cucapp.html) by Alexandre Wilhelm has been added to the blog.

#### New features

- `CPComboBoxDataSource` protocol has been added.

- `Cucapp` allows you to specify URL parameters for each test (accessible via the global variable `$url_params`).

#### Changes/Fixes

- An `objectController` can now handle several objects bound to itself.

- Delegate methods in `CPTokenField` rework.

- `CPDateFormatter` now returns by English date formatting unless other symbols have been explicitly provided or set.

- Scrolling in Firefox when using a traditional scroll wheel is now way faster.

- `CPMenu` updates its view when a bound `CPMenuItem` is notified.

- `CPDatePicker` now has the format Year/Month/Day in a `CPPredicateEditor` by default.

- In `CPTextField`, deleting a character cleared the entire field if the new text was not valid according to the assigned `CPFormatter`.

- `CPPopover` works on a platform window.

- A `CPTextField` can be edited through `Cucapp`.

- The XML dump created for `Cucapp` does not include hidden views or closed windows anymore.
