CappCon 2011 is shaping up nicely with some great speakers including legendary indie developer Wolf Rentzsch, Pete LePage from Google, Jorn van Dijk of Sofa, and of course many others.

Tickets for CappCon are now available along with more details at [http://cappcon.org](http://cappcon.org).

Also, be sure to tell your friends in person, on Twitter, and Facebook: we want to see the whole Cappuccino community there!

See you in June!
