After many months of development [Randy Luecke](http://www.twitter.com/me1000) has finally released version 1.0 of his new Cappuccino project, [TimeTable](http://timetableapp.com/)! We're proud to share in the excitement as yet another Cappuccino application is made commercially available. TimeTable is an application designed for freelancers to keep track of their projects and clients. TimeTable boasts a plethora of features including integration with web services like Google Maps, Gmail, Google Voice, and Skype.

Randy's commitment to Cappuccino is obvious when you look at the development he has done on the new CPTableView component, which was developed in parallel with TimeTable. In addition to the work he has done on CPTableView, Randy has also open sourced different components used throughout TimeTable, the most notable of which is the date picker component. Randy has been no stranger to the community as he continues to lend a helping hand in the mailing list and IRC channel. We look forward to the things Randy has in the pipeline for Cappuccino!

We'd like to share in Randy's success by sponsoring a give away of 25 TimeTable accounts. To enter simply tweet: [&ldquo;I would like to enter to win a @timetableapp account http://timetableapp.com/&rdquo;](http://twitter.com/?status=I%20would%20like%20to%20enter%20to%20win%20a%20@timetableapp%20account%20http%3A//timetableapp.com/)! On March 30th, 25 twitter users will be chosen at random to receive their free TimeTable account! If you don't win TimeTable is still more than affordable at its incredible introductory price of $34.99 a year!
