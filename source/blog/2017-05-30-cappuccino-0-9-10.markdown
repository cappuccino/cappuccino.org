We are very proud to release this new version of Cappuccino 0.9.10! This release follows a bit more than a year from 0.9.10 and as usual we were quite busy. We are pretty sure that you will be as excited as us when reading the new improvements added in Cappuccino.

#### Notable Improvements

##### CPTextView

The new `CPTextView` brings a rich control component in Cappuccino.

##### CPViewAnimator and CPAnimationContext

Cappuccino now provides an easy way to create smooth animations. Don't hesitate to take a look to the example under `Tests/Manual/CPAnimationPropertyContainerTest`.

##### Node as Javascript Engine

You can now use `node` as your javascript engine when using/building Cappuccino.
More informations can be found [here](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/blog/2017/04/cappuccino-on-node-js.html)

Cappuccino 0.9.10 will still use the javascript engine `jsc` by default. However, `node` will be the default engine from now in the master branch of Cappuccino, feel free to play with it and help to contribute to it.

Thanks to all the [Cappuccino contributors](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/graphs/contributors). We'd also like to call out Frank Rehwinkel who did the node integration with narwhal and Daniel Boehringer for his work on the CPTextView. Keep doing a good work like this! Thanks!

As always the full change log and release notes are available [here](/cappuccino-release-notes.html).

We hope you are as excited about Cappuccino 0.9.10 as we are and that you will help us spread the word, and that you will create some fantastic applications with it!
