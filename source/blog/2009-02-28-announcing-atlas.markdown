Over at [280 North](http://280north.com), we announced our next product, called Atlas, at the [Future of Web Apps](http://events.carsonified.com/fowa) conference in Miami this week.

Atlas is a visual development tool for creating web applications using the [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org) framework. The best way to explain Atlas is to show it:

[Think Vitamin has an article](http://thinkvitamin.com/features/atlas-under-the-hood/) discussing Atlas in more detail.

We're really excited about the ways Atlas could change the process of developing web applications. Atlas will allow developers to worry less about boilerplate user interface and glue code, just as the Cappuccino framework gives developers many common features expected by users, letting them focus on the ones specific to their applications.

Furthermore, Atlas allows non-programmers, such as many graphic designers, to join in on the process of actually building an application, rather than just providing mockups that must then be replicated in code by a developer.

Atlas will be available this summer. Sign up for updates on [280atlas.com](http://280atlas.com) and we'll let you know of the progress on Atlas.
